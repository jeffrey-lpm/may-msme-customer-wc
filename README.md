We're developing an app to assist small and medium enterprises with legal advice. The user interface will resemble WhatsApp's layout, but with a twist: instead of traditional chat bubbles representing contacts, they'll represent different legal departments.

So, instead of seeing someone's name in a chat bubble, you'll see the name of a legal department, like 'Agreements,' 'Employment Disputes,' and so on. This design makes it easy for users to navigate and find the right department for their needs.

On the server side, we're using Express and Node.js for the backend, along with MongoDB as the database. This combination, known as the main stack, offers several advantages:

Node.js: It's well-suited for real-time applications like chat systems due to its non-blocking, event-driven architecture. This ensures smooth, responsive communication between users and lawyers. Express: As a minimalist web framework for Node.js, Express simplifies routing, middleware, and other backend tasks, speeding up development and improving code organization. MongoDB: Being a NoSQL database, MongoDB provides flexibility in handling various types of legal documents and user data. Its document-based structure allows for efficient storage and retrieval of complex data, crucial for a legal advice platform. The app will feature an AI guide to direct users to the appropriate legal department, while human lawyers will handle the actual conversations and document exchanges. This approach ensures that users receive personalized, expert advice while leveraging AI for efficient guidance.
